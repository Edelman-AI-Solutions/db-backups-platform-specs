Your ads can also appear in Facebook Live streams from a select group of approved gaming, entertainment and sports partners. These ads appear on desktop and mobile devices, and can play before, in between or after the main video content. The ads in between the main video can show up after 15 seconds of the main video content. You can use the video format in the in-stream video placement to show off your product, service or brand in new ways. Include movement and sound to capture attention quickly and show unique features of a product or tell your brand story. The in-stream video placement will play video ads that are 15 seconds or less for the full duration of the video. The ads may also be served as skippable, which allows the user to skip the ad after the first 5 seconds. Video ads that are longer than 15 seconds will show the first 15 seconds and then truncate. Viewers will be able to resume watching the ad in its entirety by clicking on the context card that appears below the main video after ad truncation.

Reels ads provide an immersive, built-for-mobile opportunity to reach audiences seeking entertainment. You can use the video format in Reels ads to help tell your brand story in ways that are unique and authentic. Whether it's participating in trending moments through challenges or using educational tutorials to highlight products and inspire people, you should experiment with different types of video ads to discover what resonates with the community. These fullscreen vertical video ads will be inserted in between organic Reels content. Similar to organic Reels, people can comment, like, view, save, share and skip ads. Reels ads can surface in the most popular places to access Reels content. Once someone taps into a Reel from Feed or Reels tab, they will be launched into a viewing panel that exclusively shows Reels that scroll vertically. Consider leaving roughly 14% of the top, 35% of the bottom, and 6% on each side of your asset free from text, logos, or other key creative elements to avoid cropping key elements or covering them with the profile icon or call-to-action.

Reels ads provide an immersive, built-for-mobile opportunity to reach high-intent audiences engaging in entertainment through their interests.  You can use Reels ads to help tell your brand story in ways that are unique and authentic. Whether it\u2019s participating in trending moments through challenges or educating potential customers through tutorials and product education to inspire, you should experiment with different types of video ads to discover what takes off with the community.  These fullscreen vertical video ads will be inserted in between organic Reels content. Similar to organic Reels, ads can be up to 15 minutes and people can comment, like, view, save, share and skip ads. Reels ads will be surfaced in the most popular places to access Reels content. Once a user taps into a Reel from Stories, Feed, Reels Tab, or Explore, they will be launched into a viewer that exclusively shows Reels that scroll vertically.

These fullscreen vertical ads appear to viewers between organic Facebook Stories. You can use the carousel format in Facebook Stories to showcase up to 10 images within a single ad, each with its own link. With more creative space within an ad, you can highlight different products, showcase specific details about one product, service or promotion, or tell a story about your brand that develops across each carousel card. Facebook Stories will display between one to five cards automatically and give viewers the option to see the remaining carousel cards. By default, the number of carousel cards that are automatically displayed is tailored to each individual viewer.

Reels ads provide an immersive, mobile-first opportunity to reach audiences seeking entertainment. You can use the carousel format to showcase up to 10 images within a single ad, each with its own link.  Note:  To enable links for product tiles in your carousel ads, select  Catalog  or  Advantage+  catalog as your creative source in the ad setup section during the ad creation process in Meta Ads Manager.

You can use the carousel format in the Instagram Feed to showcase up to 10 images or videos within a single ad, each with its own link. With more creative space within an ad, you can highlight different products, showcase specific details about one product, service or promotion or tell a story about your brand that develops across each carousel card. Carousel ad creative may have custom positioning automatically applied to it. This means that the ad delivery system determines which piece of creative a person is most likely to respond to, and displays it first to that person. However, the overall card order remains the same regardless of who is viewing the carousel ad.

These fullscreen vertical ads appear to viewers between organic Instagram Stories. You can use the carousel format in Instagram Stories to showcase up to 10 images or videos within a single ad, each with its own link. With more creative space within an ad, you can highlight different products, showcase specific details about one product, service or promotion or tell a story about your brand that develops across each carousel card. Instagram Stories will display between 1 to 3 cards automatically before giving viewers the option to tap Expand Story to see the remaining carousel cards. By default, the number of carousel cards that are automatically displayed is tailored to each individual viewer. If you'd like a fixed number of cards to show before giving viewers the option to tap Expand Story, you can do so by selecting Instagram Stories as the exclusive placement when creating your ad in Ads Manager.

Reels ads provide an immersive, built-for-mobile opportunity to reach audiences seeking entertainment through their interests.  You can use the collection format in Facebook Reels to make it easier for people to discover, browse and purchase products and services from their mobile device in a visual and immersive way.  A collection ad in Facebook Reels includes a cover image or video with 3-4 product images at the bottom of the ad in a scrollable, horizontal layout. When someone clicks on a collection ad, they'll see an Instant Experience\u2014a fullscreen landing page that drives engagement and nurtures interest and intent. When you create an Instant Experience to use with your collection ad, you can either use the storefront or customer acquisition templates, or build a custom experience.  Collection ads in Facebook Reels can only be created when you select  Advantage+ catalog  as your creative source.

These full-screen vertical ads appear to viewers between organic Instagram Stories. You can use the collection format in the Instagram Stories to make it easier for people to discover, browse and purchase products and services from their mobile device in a visual and immersive way. A collection ad in Instagram Feed includes a cover image or video followed by 2 product images. When someone taps on a collection ad, they see an  Instant Experience \u2014a full-screen landing page that drives engagement and nurtures interest and intent. When you create your Instant Experience, you can use the Storefront or Customer Acquisition templates, or build a custom Instant Experience. To best use the vertical format of Instagram Stories, the layout of your collection ad may vary slightly depending on the ratio of the first image in your Instant Experience. You can use Ads Manager Preview to see how your collection ad will appear. Design Recommendations The cover image or video that displays in your collection ad uses the first media asset from your Instant Experience. Image Type: JPG or PNG  Video File Type: MP4, MOV or GIF  Ratio: 1.91:1 to 1:1  Resolution: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels  Consider leaving roughly 14% (250 pixels) of the top and 20% (340 pixels) of the bottom of the cover image or video free from text, logos, or other key creative elements to avoid covering them with the profile icon or call-to-action.

Learn more  about TopView . The below serves as guidelines for a TopView ad's requirements.       Before getting started Ad assets cannot be changed or replaced once the preloading happens or the campaign goes live. TopView creatives require pre-approval. Please consult your sales representative for details. Once submitted, ad assets will be reviewed by TikTok within 2 days. TikTok is not responsible for any issues caused by late asset submission. The same creative cannot be used in any other ad placement such as in-feed ads on TikTok on the same day. The same creative cannot be used the day before or after the 100% SOV TopView. For more information about our Advertising Policies, see TikTok Advertising Policies - Ad Creatives & Landing Page.       Video creative assets Spark ads pull Ad captions for Spark Ads are extracted directly from the organic video captions, and there is no caption limit on TikTok Ads. Blank caption is supported. Video format of uploaded videos is normally .mp4 or .mov. Video duration : No restrictions. Spark Ads Pull can support all video lengths on TikTok organic videos, as long as users can successfully publish the video on TikTok. Non-Spark Ads and Spark Ads Push Dimension: Vertical 9:16, \u2265540*960px Format Supported: .mp4, .mov, .mpeg, .3gp Video Duration: 5-60s, recommend 9-15s. File Size: \u2264500 MB Bitrate: \u22652,500kbps Safe zone specifications In addition to relevant ad specifications, TopView has guidance for how your creative shows up, called safe zone specifications. When producing TopView ad video creatives, please be aware of TopView's two stages: the initial 3-second zoom-in takeover, and a transition to an in-feed video experience. For some devices, when displayed full-screen in the first 3 seconds, the ad creative will be adapted to fit the full screen size. However, when the ad gets replayed in the feed, it will re-adapt to the display area of in-feed content together with the TikTok UI, so the ad will look slightly different. To make sure your TopView ad is properly displayed on the app across these two stages, please follow both open screen and in-feed safe zone specs to make sure that your key branding elements are not cropped on the devices. Below are two safe zone files: the initial open screen user experience and the in-feed component of the placement.  Note : In-feed safe zone is more restrictive than open screen. To see safe zone specifications, please download and extract the following zip file. Please note that safe zone specifications are differentiated between initial-stage and feed-stage safe zones and between left-to-right and right-to-left languages.   TopView safe zones    .zip   146.76 KB   Please ensure that the key elements such as text and logos are within the safe zone. Elements that appear out of the safe zone might be covered or cropped.  The safe zone size is determined by the ad caption length and any Interactive Add-on usage; the longer the caption, the smaller the safe zone will be. Please select the corresponding safe zone files that match your asset. The safe zone may not cover all devices. To better ensure that the creative presentation meets your expectations, we suggest that you use our  preview tool  to customize the preview for different device models and view the effects in real-time before launch. Creative requirements Use vertical, full-screen video : Always use vertical videos. Bars or frames in pure plain color are allowed as long as   main creative content remains clearly viewable and visible without overlaps and quality issues.  Plain white color cannot be allowed in the first 3 seconds   of the video   because of the low visibility of the TikTok logo. Horizontal movie trailers, which occupy the whole screen and instruct the viewers to rotate their devices in advance, can be allowed if they remain vertical in the first 3 seconds of the video.  Don\u2019t overlap : Any digital logos or key messages being overlapped with the TikTok Logo, skip button, and swipe up to skip link in the first 3-second open screen section will not be allowed by any means. Do not place any text, logos, or key messages on areas where buttons, usernames, and captions may appear in the in-feed section. Use the safe zone specs and Preview Tool to check beforehand and adjust accordingly. For reference, please consider that all text, logos, and/or key messages located fully or partially within the area highlighted in red (for the top and bottom of the screen) in the Ad Preview Tool should be rejected. Balance colors : Do not use colors that are either too dark or too bright, they may negatively impact the viewing experience. Avoid using effects that may cause visual discomfort (e.g., flashing lights). Create for sound-on : Audio must remain clear and be available (video must not be completely silent). Do not use harsh, disruptive noises, such as explosion blasts and screams, phone rings, alarms, etc., especially within the first 3 seconds. These sounds may shock your audience and cause a high skip rate. Engage with sound : Audio can't be pure verbal broadcasting. If the audio includes a promotion, it's prohibited to repeat the same sentence more than twice in a row. Use high-quality engaging creative : High-quality assets should ideally be dynamic, engaging, and similar to organic TikTok videos. To ensure attractive and eye-catching ads, materials must include either imagery containing real people or high-quality animations that have a storyline. High-quality animations should be animations with a full narrative or a preview of a full-length animation. On the other hand, the following will not be allowed as the main narrative elements of the ad, as it may make for a boring and unimpressive viewing experience: Still pictures If an asset contains the low-quality element above, it can only be allowed if it's not present in the first 3 seconds of the video and for more than half of the video's duration. Don\u2019t mislead with visuals : Do not use misleading visuals that may cause confusion, such as stop/play buttons, incoming call screens, text messages, prize draws, etc. Don\u2019t show contact info : Do not include contact information in your ads, such as QR codes, barcodes, contact numbers, and addresses. Note : Contact information is allowed for required disclaimers due to the nature of advertised services (e.g., Gambling, Healthcare - when allowed). Keep content comfortable : Do not use inappropriate content such as sexual scenes (e.g., intense kissing or touching), especially at the beginning of your ad. Abide by  TikTok's advertising policies  and prevent discomfort among your audience, or a negative reaction to your brand. Note : TopView campaigns are limited to 20 ads per ad group.  Additional creative requirements for gaming Showcase the game : Videos solely showing screen recordings are not allowed. Try to add a creative twist, and showcase your game in an appealing way to captivate the audience. Keep it friendly : Videos solely showing fighting scenes and/or scenes that may cause discomfort while watching (such as body piercing, bleeding, violence, etc.) are not allowed. Don\u2019t induce users : Do not use money motivation, free VIP status, or other incentives to induce users to download your game.       Profile Photo Dimension: Square 1:1, 98x98px Format Supported: .jpg, .jpeg, .png File Size: <50 KB If it is Spark Ads, the profile photo will use the photo of the video account profile.

When producing TopView ad video creatives, please be aware of TopView's two stages: the initial 3-second zoom-in takeover, and a transition to an in-feed video experience. For some devices, when displayed full-screen in the first 3 seconds, the ad creative will be adapted to fit the full screen size. However, when the ad gets replayed in the feed, it will re-adapt to the display area of in-feed content together with the TikTok UI, so the ad will look slightly different. To make sure your TopView ad is properly displayed on the app across these two stages, please follow both open screen and in-feed safe zone specs to make sure that your key branding elements are not cropped on the devices. Below are two safe zone files: the initial open screen user experience and the in-feed component of the placement. <strong>Note</strong>: In-feed safe zone is more restrictive than open screen.</p><br><p>To see safe zone specifications, please download and extract the following zip file. Please note that safe zone specifications are differentiated between initial-stage and feed-stage safe zones and between left-to-right and right-to-left languages.</p><div class=\"tt4b-renderer\"><div muted=\"muted\" title=\"TopView safe zones \" align=\"left\" controls=\"controls\" file=\"[object Object]\" src=\"https://lf-tt4b.tiktokcdn.com/obj/i18nblog/tt4b_cms/en-US/5jqet0ab9qci-4AFzjTVoe0R81g2hdu6Nqz.zip\" contenttype=\"application/zip\" alt=\"TopView safe zones \" class=\"flex place-content-between container rounded w-full md:w-[32.5rem] h-[4.375rem] px-[1rem] py-[0.688rem] my-[0.625rem] block align-middle max-w-full tt4b-asset-renderer\" style=\"border:1px solid #f0f0f0;\"><div class=\"flex justify-between w-full\"><div class=\"flex\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" data-click_type=\"icon\" data-url=\"\" data-custom_icon_name=\"zip\" class=\"tt4b-icon tt4b-icon--zip\" style=\"color:;width:1.875rem;height:1.875rem;background-color:;border-radius:;\"><use xlink:href=\"#tt4b-icon-zip\"></use></svg> <div class=\" flex flex-col justify-center px-[0.625rem]\"><div class=\"flex flex-row align-middle\"><span class=\"inline-block overflow-hidden overflow-ellipsis whitespace-nowrap max-w-[22.188rem]\">TopView safe zones </span> <span>.zip</span></div> <span class=\"tt4b-file__size\">146.76 KB</span></div></div> <div class=\"hover:cursor-pointer\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" data-click_type=\"icon\" data-url=\"\" data-custom_icon_name=\"download\" class=\"tt4b-icon tt4b-icon--download\" style=\"color:;width:1rem;height:1rem;background-color:;border-radius:;\"><use xlink:href=\"#tt4b-icon-download\"></use></svg></div></div></div></div><br><ul><li><p>Please ensure that the key elements such as text and logos are within the safe zone.

Please select the corresponding safe zone files that match your asset.</p></li><li><p>The safe zone may not cover all devices. To better ensure that the creative presentation meets your expectations, we suggest that you use our <a href=\"https://ads.tiktok.com/standalone-preview/home\" target=\"_blank\" data-click_type=\"text_link\" data-click_for=\"rich_text\" data-url_type=\"link\" data-click_text=\"preview tool\">preview tool</a> to customize the preview for different device models and view the effects in real-time before launch.</p></li></ul><br><h4 id=\"anchor-2-4\" class=\"__anchor-header__\">Creative requirements</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Use vertical, full-screen video</strong>: Always use vertical videos. Bars or frames in pure plain color are allowed as long as<strong> </strong>main creative content remains clearly viewable and visible without overlaps and quality issues. </p><ul><li><p>Plain white color cannot be allowed in the first 3 seconds<strong> </strong>of the video<strong> </strong>because of the low visibility of the TikTok logo.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Horizontal movie trailers, which occupy the whole screen and instruct the viewers to rotate their devices in advance, can be allowed if they remain vertical in the first 3 seconds of the video. </p></li><li><p><strong>Don\u2019t overlap</strong>: Any digital logos or key messages being overlapped with the TikTok Logo, skip button, and swipe up to skip link in the first 3-second open screen section will not be allowed by any means. Do not place any text, logos, or key messages on areas where buttons, usernames, and captions may appear in the in-feed section. Use the safe zone specs and Preview Tool to check beforehand and adjust accordingly.</p><ul><li><p>For reference, please consider that all text, logos, and/or key messages located fully or partially within the area highlighted in red (for the top and bottom of the screen) in the Ad Preview Tool should be rejected.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Balance colors</strong>: Do not use colors that are either too dark or too bright, they may negatively impact the viewing experience. Avoid using effects that may cause visual discomfort (e.g., flashing lights).</p></li><li><p><strong>Create for sound-on</strong>: Audio must remain clear and be available (video must not be completely silent). Do not use harsh, disruptive noises, such as explosion blasts and screams, phone rings, alarms, etc., especially within the first 3 seconds. These sounds may shock your audience and cause a high skip rate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Engage with sound</strong>: Audio can't be pure verbal broadcasting. If the audio includes a promotion, it's prohibited to repeat the same sentence more than twice in a row.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use high-quality engaging creative</strong>: High-quality assets should ideally be dynamic, engaging, and similar to organic TikTok videos. To ensure attractive and eye-catching ads, materials must include either imagery containing real people or high-quality animations that have a storyline. High-quality animations should be animations with a full narrative or a preview of a full-length animation.</p><ul><li><p>On the other hand, the following will not be allowed as the main narrative elements of the ad, as it may make for a boring and unimpressive viewing experience:</p><ul><li><p>Still pictures</p></li></ul></li><li><p>If an asset contains the low-quality element above, it can only be allowed if it's not present in the first 3 seconds of the video and for more than half of the video's duration.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Don\u2019t mislead with visuals</strong>: Do not use misleading visuals that may cause confusion, such as stop/play buttons, incoming call screens, text messages, prize draws, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don\u2019t show contact info</strong>: Do not include contact information in your ads, such as QR codes, barcodes, contact numbers, and addresses.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Note</strong>: Contact information is allowed for required disclaimers due to the nature of advertised services (e.g., Gambling, Healthcare - when allowed).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Keep content comfortable</strong>: Do not use inappropriate content such as sexual scenes (e.g., intense kissing or touching), especially at the beginning of your ad.

Music is essential for Carousel Ads. You can either choose music from the CML or upload your own.  CML music, however, is not available for TikTok Pangle placements. If you select CML music for your Carousel Ads, it will only play on TikTok, making the ads silent for TikTok Pangle placement. For carousel ads for TikTok Pangle placement only, we only support uploaded music, and CML music options are disabled in the Ads Manager platform. Music Options by Placement In the TikTok Ad Manager platform, during Carousel Ads creation, you can select music from the  Music Builder  page, which offers four different options for music sources. Click on one of these options to choose the music for your Carousel Ads. All music provided by the platform, unless uploaded by you, comes from the Commercial Music Library (CML). For You : Contains music from the Commercial Music Library (CML), which can be used on TikTok but is unavailable for TikTok Pangle Carousel Ads placement. Liked : Includes music from CML,  which can be used on TikTok but is unavailable for TikTok Pangle Carousel Ads placement. History : Features a mix of CML music, which can be used on TikTok but not on TikTok Pangle, and uploaded music, which is available for use on both TikTok and TikTok Pangle. Uploaded : Advertisers can upload their own music, which is compatible with both TikTok and TikTok Pangle placements. Avoiding Silent Carousel Ads Option 1 : To have consistent music across both TikTok and TikTok Pangle, upload your own music instead of using CML music. Option 2 : If you prefer using CML music, create two separate Carousel Ads: For TikTok : Select \"TikTok only\" at the Ad group level and choose CML music at the Ads level. For TikTok Pangle : Select \"TikTok Pangle only\" at the Ad group level and upload your own music at the Ads level.", "<div><h1 class=\"article_wrapper_slug_title\">Specifications for Carousel Ads</h1> <div class=\"article_wrapper_slug_updated_time\">\n            Last updated: September 2025\n          </div> <div class=\"article_wrapper_slug_center_body\"><div id=\"article_wrapper_slug_content\" class=\"article_wrapper_slug_content\"><div><div class=\"tt4b-rich-text-box\"><p>Each Carousel format has requirements for the image, music, or ad you select.

As you prepare your catalog and creative assets for launch, use this guide to ensure everything follows the creative specifications.       Video creatives Dimensions: Vertical (recommended): 9:16, more than or equal to 540*960px. Horizontal: 16:9, more than or equal to 960*540px. Square: 1:1, more than or equal to 640*640px File formats: .mp4, .mov, .mpeg, .3gp .avi. Video duration: 5-60s, recommend 21-34s. File size: Less than or equal to 500 MB. Bitrate: More than or equal to 516 kbps. Video safe zones To find downloadable safe zone files, go to  TikTok auction in-feed ads . Product images Supported format: .jpg, .jpeg, .png If uploading your catalog using the URL or CSV method, use an image link. If you don't have image links, you'll need to use the manual upload method. Product images should follow a 4:3 aspect ratio, with preferred dimensions of 800*600px. If using carousel, vertical (9:16) images may be possible. Check that the focus of your image (for example, car image or offer) sits within the center. Minimum dimensions: 450*450px If your images are smaller,  contact support  to check if there is an alternate solution. Your image should be clear, with minimal \"dead space\" around the vehicle to maximize its visibility. End card / final slide This asset is different from your product images and is displayed at the end of your carousel or product card list. Clicking the end card or final slide will take a user to browse your full inventory, either on a Vehicle Inventory Page or a URL of your choice. Typically, a logo or graphic is used in this slot. Note the differences in specs for video and carousel: Dimensions for video end card: 800*600px Dimensions for carousel final slide: 1200*628px, 640*640px, or 720*1080px", "<div><h1 class=\"article_wrapper_slug_title\">Creative specifications for Automotive Ads</h1> <div class=\"article_wrapper_slug_updated_time\">\n            Last updated: July 2025\n          </div> <div class=\"article_wrapper_slug_center_body\"><div id=\"article_wrapper_slug_content\" class=\"article_wrapper_slug_content\"><div><div class=\"tt4b-rich-text-box\"><p>Automotive Ads use a variety of images and videos to promote your vehicles.

Uploading media with OAuth can be a bit tricky, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outlined some things to keep in mind as well as a working sample of how to use this endpoint here. \n \n Keep in mind \n \n Because the method uses multipart POST,  OAuth  is handled differently. POST or query string parameters are not used when calculating an OAuth signature basestring or signature. Only the  oauth_*  parameters are used. \n You may attach up to 4 photos, 1 animated GIF or 1 video in a Tweet. \n The image passed should be the raw binary of the image or binary base64 encoded, no need to otherwise encode or escape the contents as long as the Content-Type is set appropriately (when in doubt:  application/octet-stream ). \n When posting base64 encoded images, be sure to set the \u00e2\u0080\u009cContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the image part of the message. \n Multi-part message boundaries must be on their own line and terminated by a CRLF. \n For working examples of how to POST using this endpoint, we recommend testing with  twurl . Also, take a look at the  Twitter Libraries  available, including the  large-video-upload-python  library. \n Use the  media_id_string  provided in the API response for Javascript and any other languages that cannot accurately represent a long integer. \n\u00c2\u00a0 \n \n Media Categories \n The Media Category parameter defines the use case of the media file to be uploaded, and can affect file size limits or other constraints enforced for media uploads. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to use the correct media category when uploading media to avoid problems when trying to use the media. It is an optional value passed in the INIT request as part of the upload flow. If media category is not specified, the uploaded media is assumed to be a Tweet media (image, video, or GIF), depending on the content type. \n The most common media categories are as follows: \n \n tweet_image \n tweet_video \n tweet_gif \n dm_image \n dm_video \n dm_gif \n subtitles \n \n If you are an Ads API partner please refer to  these docs  for more information on recommended media category for promoted video. \n \n \n Image specifications and recommendations \n Image files must meet all of the following criteria: \n \n Supported image media types: JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP \n Image size <= 5 MB, animated GIF size <= 15 MB \n \n The file size limit above is enforced by the media upload endpoint. In addition, there is a separate product entity specific file size limit which is applied when calling the Tweet creation (or similar) endpoints with  media_id . The file size limit and other constraints may vary depending on the  media_category  parameter. \n \n \n Animated GIF recommendations \n A GIF may fail during Tweet creation even if it is within the file size limit. Adhere to the following constraints to improve success rates. \n \n Resolution should be <= 1280x1080 (width x height) \n Number of frames <= 350 \n Number of pixels (width * height * num_frames) <= 300 million \n File size <= 15Mb \n \n In order to process larger GIFs, use the  chunked upload endpoint  with the  media_category  parameter. This allows the server to process the GIF file asynchronously, which is a requirement for processing larger files. Pass  media_category=tweet_gif  to enable async upload behavior for Tweets with an animated GIF. \n\u00c2\u00a0 \n Video specifications and recommendations \n Please use the  Async Path  for media uploads. \n Recommended: \n \n Recommended Video Codec: H264 High Profile \n Recommended Frame Rates: 30 FPS, 60 FPS \n Recommended Video Resolution: 1280x720 (landscape), 720x1280 (portrait), 720x720 (square). Subscribed users can upload a 1080p video and get 1080p playback. Unsubscribed users can upload a 720p video and get a 720p playback. \n Recommended Minimum Video Bitrate: 5,000 kbps \n Recommended Minimum Audio Bitrate: 128 kbps \n Recommended Audio Codec: AAC LC \n Recommended Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (landscape or portrait), 1:1 (square) \n \n Advanced: \n \n Frame rate must be 60 FPS or less \n Dimensions must be between 32x32 and 1280x1024 \n File size must not exceed 512 mb \n Duration must be between 0.5 seconds and 140 seconds \n Aspect ratio must be between 1:3 and 3:1 \n Must have 1:1  pixel aspect ratio \n Only  YUV  4:2:0 pixel format is supported \n Audio must be  AAC with Low Complexity profile .
