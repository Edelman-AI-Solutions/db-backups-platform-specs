I've used LWPx::Paranoid a few times, and it's great, but eventually it boils down to, either you can afford to spend 10 seconds in your web handlers waiting for a remote response to come back, or you can't. You have a limited number of processes that can handle connections, or you're threaded/event driven and are limited by CPU and it doesn't matter as much if you're waiting on remote resources.</p>\\n<p>And in the former case, having a user agent that promises to only take 10 seconds to return is still going to take 10 entire seconds to return.  I can still tie up your entire webserver if I can get 100 processes to do that at once.</p>\\n<p>In the past I've only managed to to this stuff properly/safely in a process-limited environment by putting something onto a queue and having a queue-worker job fetch remote urls, while the front-end polls the web server for status every 30 seconds.

It's preferable to have one's email provider stay in business; however, some people can mitigate this by using their own domain. Gmail and Blogger are examples of services that let you use their domain, or your own. The same is with OpenID, for the vast majority of people, using a major provider like Google, Yahoo, or Facebook directly may be the easy way to go. For those that want to use less popular service providers, delegation allows one to take on some more provider risk without increasing your identity risk.
