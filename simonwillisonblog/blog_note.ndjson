AI overview from Search Labs shows the following: The saying &quot;a swan won't prevent a hurricane&quot; means that no matter how well-intentioned or seemingly harmless a person (or in this case, a swan) might be, they can't stop or prevent a large, destructive event like a hurricane. It highlights the idea that some things are simply too powerful or inevitable to be stopped by individual actions or efforts. Here's a more detailed breakdown: Swan: In this context, a swan is used as a symbol of something small, harmless, and insignificant. Hurricane: A hurricane is a powerful and destructive natural phenomenon, representing something large, overwhelming, and inevitable. The Saying's Meaning: The saying emphasizes that even the best efforts of a seemingly powerless entity (the swan) cannot alter the course or impact of a powerful, destructive event (the hurricane). In essence, &quot;a swan won't prevent a hurricane&quot; is a reminder that sometimes, we need to accept that certain events are simply beyond our control.

The industry managed to keep the evidence from us for decades, but finally a marketing agency of a local newspaper chain has blown the lid off the whole thing, in a bunch of blog posts and PDFs and on a podcast.</li>\r\n<li>Everyone believed that their phone was listening to them even when it wasn\u2019t.

write code\". It means \"generating code with AI and not even reviewing what comes out\". This is a hill I am willing to die on. I fear it will be the death of me.\r\n\r\nI just I learned about not one but *two* forthcoming books that use vibe coding in the title and abuse that very clear definition!\r\n\r\n**Vibe Coding** by Gene Kim and Steve Yegge (published by IT Revolution) carries the subtitle \"Building Production-Grade Software With GenAI, Chat, Agents, and Beyond\" - exactly what vibe coding is not.\r\n\r\n**Vibe Coding: The Future of Programming** by Addie Osmani (published by O'Reilly Media) likewise talks about how professional engineers can integrate AI-assisted coding tools into their workflow.\r\n\r\nI fear it may be too late for these authors and publishers to fix their embarrassing mistake: they've already designed the cover art!\r\n\r\nBOOKS\r\n\r\nI wonder if this a new record for the time from a term being coined to the first published books that use that term entirely incorrectly.\r\n\r\nVibe coding was only coined on February 6th, 84 days ago. I will once again quote [Andrej's tweet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383), with my own highlights for emphasis:\r\n\r\n> There\u2019s a new kind of coding I call \u201cvibe coding\u201d, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and **forget that the code even exists**. It\u2019s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.\r\n>\r\n> I ask for the dumbest things like \u201cdecrease the padding on the sidebar by half\u201d because I\u2019m too lazy to find it. I \u201cAccept All\u201d always, I don\u2019t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I\u2019d have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can\u2019t fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.\r\n>\r\n> **It\u2019s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing**. I\u2019m building a project or webapp, but it\u2019s not really coding\u2014I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.\r\n\r\nAndrej could not have stated this more clearly: vibe coding is when you **forget that the code even exists**, as a fun way to build **throwaway projects**. It's not the same thing as using LLM tools as part of your process for responsibly building production code.\r\n\r\nI know it's harder now that tweets are longer than 480 characters, but it's vitally important you **read to the end of the tweet** before publishing a book about something!\r\n\r\n#### Now what do we call books on about real vibe coding?\r\n\r\nThis is the aspect of this whole thing that most disappoints me.\r\n\r\nI think there is a real need for a book on *actual* vibe coding: helping people who are *not* software developers - and who don't want to become developers - learn how to use vibe coding techniques safely, effectively and responsibly to solve their problems.\r\n\r\nThis is a rich, deep topic! Most of the population of the world are never going to learn to code, but thanks to vibe coding tools those people now have a path to building custom software.\r\n\r\nEveryone deserves the right to automate tedious things in their lives with a computer. They shouldn't have to learn programming in order to do that. **That** is who vibe coding is for. It's not for people who are software engineers already!\r\n\r\nThere are so many questions to be answered here. What kind of projects can be built in this way? How can you avoid the traps around security, privacy, reliability and a risk of over-spending? How can you navigate the jagged frontier of things that can be achieved in this way versus things that are completely impossible?\r\n\r\nA book for people like that could be a genuine bestseller! But because three authors and the staff of two publishers didn't read to the end of the tweet now we'll need to find a new term for that, despite having the *perfect* term for it already.\r\n\r\nI know I'm [tilting at windmills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote#Tilting_at_windmills) here. I'm going to continue to tilt.", null, ""]
